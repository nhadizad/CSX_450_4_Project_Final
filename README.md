# Housing Sale Prices in Ames, Iowa

## Domain
The problem is drawn from the study of data related to the sales of individual residential properties in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.

## Problem Statement
We will use supervised learning to develop a number of regression models, and we will compare the scores of these models to determine the best approach.

## Dataset
The Ames, Iowa data set has 2930 observations and a total of 80 explanatory variables, including the target of sale price.

For the detailed description of data refer to the document in the data folder.

## Solution
For this project, we will use five different regression models, to pick the best results. These include Ridge, Lasso, k Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine regression.

## Benchmark Model
A naive benchmark would be to select the mean or median of the sale price.

## Performance Metric
We can measure the success of our model using the $R^2$ score.
